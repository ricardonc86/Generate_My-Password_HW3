# Creating a Password Generator Application

The purpose of this project is to put to test my new learned Javascript capabilities. The basic purpose of this project enables the client to generate random passwords based on the criteria they selected. The password will be constructed automatically and randomly using only numbers, alphabet and special characters. By undergoing this project I understand the basic understandings of the fundamentals of Javascript put to use on everyday applications.
